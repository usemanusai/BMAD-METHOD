### 2. Complexity Assessment Algorithm

**Multi-Dimensional Complexity Scoring:**

```
Complexity Score = Σ(Weight_i × Factor_i)

Where factors include:
- Functional Complexity (0-10): Number and complexity of required functions
- Integration Complexity (0-10): Number and complexity of system integrations
- Compliance Complexity (0-10): Regulatory and compliance requirements
- Stakeholder Complexity (0-10): Number and diversity of stakeholders
- Technical Complexity (0-10): Advanced technical requirements
- Timeline Complexity (0-10): Urgency and timeline constraints
```

**Complexity Categories:**
- **Simple (0-20):** Basic agent teams, minimal integration, standard workflows
- **Moderate (21-40):** Multi-agent teams, some integration, industry-specific needs
- **Complex (41-60):** Large teams, extensive integration, compliance requirements
- **Enterprise (61-80):** Multi-domain teams, complex governance, advanced features
- **Strategic (81-100):** Organization-wide impact, maximum complexity and scale

### 3. Intelligent Agent Selection Algorithm

**Capability Mapping Matrix:**

```
Agent Selection Score = Σ(Capability_Match × Requirement_Weight × Efficiency_Factor)

For each meta-agent:
- Capability_Match: How well agent capabilities match requirements (0-1)
- Requirement_Weight: Importance of requirement to overall success (0-1)
- Efficiency_Factor: Agent's efficiency for this type of work (0-1)
```

**Selection Criteria:**
1. **Functional Alignment:** Agent capabilities match functional requirements
2. **Industry Expertise:** Agent has relevant industry-specific knowledge
3. **Compliance Capability:** Agent can handle required compliance needs
4. **Integration Ability:** Agent can manage required system integrations
5. **Scalability Support:** Agent can handle expected scale and growth
6. **Resource Efficiency:** Agent provides optimal resource utilization

### 4. Dynamic Team Composition

**Optimal Team Size Calculation:**

```
Optimal_Team_Size = Base_Size + Complexity_Modifier + Integration_Modifier + Compliance_Modifier

Where:
- Base_Size: Minimum agents needed for core functionality (2-4)
- Complexity_Modifier: Additional agents based on complexity score (0-6)
- Integration_Modifier: Additional agents for complex integrations (0-3)
- Compliance_Modifier: Additional agents for compliance requirements (0-2)
```

**Team Composition Rules:**
- Always include core orchestration and quality assurance agents
- Add industry specialists for domain-specific requirements
- Include compliance officers for regulated industries
- Add integration specialists for complex system connections
- Include performance analysts for high-scale requirements

### 5. Automatic Task Sequencing

**Dependency Analysis:**
- Identify task prerequisites and dependencies
- Create dependency graph for optimal sequencing
- Identify critical path for timeline optimization
- Plan parallel execution opportunities
- Allocate resources for optimal throughput

**Dynamic Sequencing Algorithm:**

```
1. Parse all required tasks and their dependencies
2. Create directed acyclic graph (DAG) of task relationships
3. Identify critical path using longest path algorithm
4. Group independent tasks for parallel execution
5. Optimize resource allocation across parallel tasks
6. Generate execution timeline with milestones
```
