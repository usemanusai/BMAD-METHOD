# Orchestrate Agent Creation Task

## Purpose

Coordinate the complete process of creating a new agent team from initial requirements through deployment. This task manages the complex workflow involving multiple meta-agents and ensures high-quality outcomes through systematic orchestration.

## Instructions

### 1. Project Initialization and Planning

**Assess User Requirements:**
- Gather initial requirements and understand the scope
- Determine the complexity and scale of the agent team needed
- Assess user preferences for interaction style (Interactive vs YOLO)
- Identify any special constraints or requirements

**Select Orchestration Approach:**
- **Interactive Mode:** Step-by-step process with user feedback at each stage
- **YOLO Mode:** Streamlined process with minimal user intervention
- **Hybrid Mode:** Combination approach based on complexity and user preferences

**Create Project Plan:**
- Define project scope and objectives
- Identify required meta-agents and their roles
- Establish timeline and milestones
- Set quality criteria and success metrics

### 2. Meta-Agent Team Assembly

**Activate Required Meta-Agents:**
- **Agent Architect (Timmy-Meta):** For requirements analysis and team design
- **Persona Creator (Sarah-Meta):** For agent personality and behavior design
- **Configuration Manager (Bill-Meta):** For technical configuration and setup
- **Agent Tester (Karen-Meta):** For validation and quality assurance
- **Deployment Specialist (James-Meta):** For deployment and integration

**Establish Coordination Protocols:**
- Set up communication channels between meta-agents
- Define handoff procedures and data formats
- Establish quality gates and review points
- Create shared workspace and documentation standards

### 3. Phase 1: Requirements Analysis and Team Design

**Coordinate Requirements Analysis:**
- Direct Agent Architect to conduct comprehensive requirements analysis
- Ensure thorough stakeholder analysis and workflow mapping
- Review and validate requirements analysis output
- Gather user feedback and iterate as needed

**Orchestrate Team Design:**
- Guide Agent Architect through team composition design
- Facilitate user review of proposed agent team structure
- Coordinate refinements based on feedback
- Finalize agent team architecture and specifications

**Quality Gate 1:**
- [ ] Requirements are comprehensive and validated
- [ ] Agent team design is optimal for the requirements
- [ ] User has approved the overall approach
- [ ] All dependencies and constraints are identified

### 4. Phase 2: Persona and Configuration Development

**Coordinate Persona Creation:**
- Assign Persona Creator to develop agent personalities
- Ensure personas align with functional requirements
- Facilitate user review and feedback on personas
- Iterate on persona designs until approved

**Orchestrate Configuration Management:**
- Direct Configuration Manager to create technical configurations
- Ensure proper integration with existing BMAD infrastructure
- Coordinate template and checklist assignments
- Validate configuration completeness and accuracy

**Manage Parallel Development:**
- Coordinate simultaneous persona and configuration development
- Ensure consistency between personality and technical specifications
- Facilitate communication between Persona Creator and Configuration Manager
- Resolve any conflicts or inconsistencies

**Quality Gate 2:**
- [ ] All agent personas are complete and approved
- [ ] Technical configurations are accurate and complete
- [ ] Personas and configurations are consistent
- [ ] Integration requirements are properly addressed

### 5. Phase 3: Testing and Validation

**Orchestrate Comprehensive Testing:**
- Direct Agent Tester to conduct thorough validation
- Coordinate testing of individual agents and team interactions
- Ensure performance testing meets requirements
- Validate user experience and interaction quality

**Manage Feedback Integration:**
- Collect and analyze testing results
- Coordinate necessary refinements with appropriate meta-agents
- Ensure all issues are resolved before deployment
- Validate that changes don't introduce new problems

**Quality Gate 3:**
- [ ] All agents pass individual functionality tests
- [ ] Team interactions work as designed
- [ ] Performance meets specified requirements
- [ ] User experience is satisfactory

### 6. Phase 4: Deployment and Integration

**Coordinate Deployment Planning:**
- Direct Deployment Specialist to create deployment plan
- Ensure proper integration with existing systems
- Plan rollback procedures and risk mitigation
- Coordinate user training and documentation

**Orchestrate Deployment Execution:**
- Oversee deployment process execution
- Monitor for issues and coordinate rapid resolution
- Ensure proper handoff to operational teams
- Validate successful deployment and integration

**Quality Gate 4:**
- [ ] Deployment is successful and stable
- [ ] Integration with existing systems works properly
- [ ] Users can effectively interact with new agent team
- [ ] Monitoring and maintenance procedures are in place

### 7. Project Completion and Handoff

**Conduct Project Review:**
- Assess overall project success against initial objectives
- Gather feedback from all stakeholders
- Document lessons learned and best practices
- Identify opportunities for improvement

**Prepare Handoff Documentation:**
- Create comprehensive agent team documentation
- Provide user guides and training materials
- Document maintenance and evolution procedures
- Establish ongoing support and improvement processes

**Archive Project Artifacts:**
- Store all project documentation and artifacts
- Update meta-agent knowledge bases with lessons learned
- Contribute to organizational learning and improvement
- Prepare for future similar projects

### 8. Continuous Monitoring and Improvement

**Establish Monitoring Framework:**
- Set up performance monitoring for the new agent team
- Create feedback collection mechanisms
- Establish regular review and optimization cycles
- Plan for future enhancements and evolution

**Knowledge Capture:**
- Document successful patterns and approaches
- Update meta-agent templates and processes
- Share insights with the broader BMAD community
- Contribute to meta-agent system evolution

## Coordination Strategies

### Communication Management
