# Requirements Analysis Task for Agent Team Design

## Purpose

Transform user requirements and problem descriptions into comprehensive analysis that serves as the foundation for designing optimal agent teams. This analysis will guide all subsequent meta-agent activities including team composition, persona creation, and configuration management.

## Instructions

### 1. Initial Requirements Gathering

**Conduct Comprehensive Discovery:**
- Ask probing questions to understand the full scope of the problem domain
- Identify all stakeholders and their specific needs
- Understand the current state and desired future state
- Clarify success criteria and constraints

**Key Discovery Questions:**
1. "What is the primary problem or challenge you're trying to solve?"
2. "Who are the main users/stakeholders that will interact with this agent team?"
3. "What are the key workflows or processes that need to be supported?"
4. "What are your performance expectations and success metrics?"
5. "Are there any existing systems or constraints we need to consider?"
6. "What is the expected volume and complexity of work?"
7. "Do you have any preferences for agent interaction styles or personalities?"

### 2. Problem Domain Analysis

**Decompose the Problem Space:**
- Break down complex requirements into manageable components
- Identify core functional areas and their relationships
- Map dependencies between different aspects of the problem
- Categorize requirements by complexity and priority

**Functional Analysis:**
- Primary functions that must be performed
- Secondary functions that add value
- Support functions required for operation
- Integration functions for external systems

**Non-Functional Analysis:**
- Performance requirements (speed, throughput, accuracy)
- Scalability needs (current and future volume)
- Reliability and availability expectations
- Security and compliance requirements
- Usability and user experience goals

### 3. Stakeholder Analysis

**Identify Key Stakeholders:**
- Primary users who will directly interact with agents
- Secondary users who will consume agent outputs
- System administrators and maintainers
- Business stakeholders and decision makers

**For Each Stakeholder Group:**
- Define their specific needs and expectations
- Identify their preferred interaction styles
- Understand their technical proficiency levels
- Map their role in the overall workflow
- Document any special requirements or constraints

### 4. Workflow and Process Mapping

**Current State Analysis:**
- Document existing workflows and processes
- Identify pain points and inefficiencies
- Map current tools and systems in use
- Understand handoff points and bottlenecks

**Future State Design:**
- Define desired workflows with agent assistance
- Identify opportunities for automation
- Plan for human-agent collaboration points
- Design efficient handoff procedures

### 5. Requirements Categorization and Prioritization

**Categorize Requirements:**
- **Must-Have:** Critical requirements for MVP functionality
- **Should-Have:** Important requirements for full functionality
- **Could-Have:** Nice-to-have features for enhanced experience
- **Won't-Have:** Out of scope for current implementation

**Prioritization Factors:**
- Business value and impact
- Technical complexity and effort
- Dependencies and prerequisites
- Risk and uncertainty levels

### 6. Agent Team Scope Definition

**Determine Agent Team Boundaries:**
- Define what will be handled by the agent team
- Identify interfaces with external systems
- Establish scope limitations and exclusions
- Plan for future expansion possibilities

**Integration Requirements:**
- External APIs and data sources
- Existing tools and systems
- File formats and data structures
- Communication protocols

### 7. Success Criteria and Metrics

**Define Measurable Success Criteria:**
- Quantitative metrics (speed, accuracy, volume)
- Qualitative measures (user satisfaction, ease of use)
- Business outcomes (cost savings, efficiency gains)
- Technical performance indicators

**Establish Baseline and Targets:**
- Current state performance (if applicable)
- Target performance levels
- Acceptable performance ranges
- Monitoring and measurement approaches

### 8. Risk and Constraint Analysis

**Identify Potential Risks:**
- Technical risks and mitigation strategies
- User adoption challenges
- Integration complexities
- Performance bottlenecks

**Document Constraints:**
- Technical limitations and dependencies
- Budget and resource constraints
- Timeline and delivery requirements
- Regulatory and compliance needs

### 9. Requirements Documentation

**Produce Comprehensive Requirements Analysis:**
Using the `agent-requirements-analysis.md` template, create a detailed document that includes:

- Executive summary of the problem and solution approach
- Detailed functional and non-functional requirements
- Stakeholder analysis and needs mapping
- Workflow and process definitions
- Success criteria and metrics
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Recommendations for agent team composition

### 10. Validation and Refinement

**Review with Stakeholders:**
- Present the requirements analysis for validation
- Gather feedback and clarifications
- Identify any gaps or missing requirements
- Refine and update the analysis as needed

**Prepare for Next Phase:**
- Ensure requirements are clear and actionable
- Provide recommendations for agent team design
- Identify any additional research or analysis needed
- Set expectations for the design phase

## Output Deliverables

1. **Requirements Analysis Document** - Comprehensive analysis using the template
2. **Stakeholder Map** - Visual representation of stakeholders and their relationships
3. **Workflow Diagrams** - Current and future state process flows
4. **Requirements Traceability Matrix** - Mapping of requirements to business objectives
5. **Agent Team Recommendations** - Initial thoughts on team composition and structure
