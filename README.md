The **BMAD Meta-Agent System** is a revolutionary enterprise platform featuring **AI agents that create AI agent teams**. This self-improving system automatically analyzes problem domains and generates optimized agent teams tailored to solve specific business challenges across industries.

## 🚀 What Makes This Revolutionary?

Unlike traditional AI implementations, the BMAD Meta-Agent System features **intelligent agents that design and deploy other agent teams**. Using advanced natural language processing and machine learning, the system transforms high-level business requirements into fully functional, enterprise-ready agent teams in hours instead of weeks.

### 🎯 Core Innovation: Meta-Agents

**Meta-agents** are specialized AI agents whose purpose is to create, configure, test, and deploy other AI agent teams. They operate at a higher level of abstraction, solving the problem of optimal agent team composition and deployment.
