cp -r bmad-agent bmad-agent-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Verify backup
ls -la bmad-agent-backup-*
```

### Step 2: Install Meta-Agent Files

#### Option A: From Git Repository (Recommended)
```bash
# If using the meta-agent-builder branch
git checkout meta-agent-builder

# Verify meta-agent files are present
ls -la bmad-agent/meta-agents/
```

#### Option B: Manual Installation
```bash
# Create meta-agent directory structure
mkdir -p bmad-agent/meta-agents/{personas,tasks,templates,checklists,data}

# Copy meta-agent files (adjust paths as needed)
cp -r [source]/meta-agents/* bmad-agent/meta-agents/
```

### Step 3: Update BMAD Configuration

#### For IDE Usage

Edit `bmad-agent/ide-bmad-orchestrator.cfg.md` and add:

```markdown
## Meta-Agent Section

### Title: Meta-Agent Orchestrator
- Name: Meta-BMad
- Customize: ""
- Description: "Central orchestrator for meta-agent operations"
- Persona: "meta-agents/personas/meta-orchestrator.md"
- Tasks:
  - [Orchestrate Agent Creation](meta-agents/tasks/orchestrate-agent-creation.md)

### Title: Agent Architecture Designer
- Name: Timmy-Meta
- Customize: ""
- Description: "Specializes in analyzing problem domains and designing optimal agent team compositions"
- Persona: "meta-agents/personas/agent-architect.md"
- Tasks:
  - [Analyze Requirements](meta-agents/tasks/analyze-requirements.md)
```

#### For Web Usage

Edit `bmad-agent/web-bmad-orchestrator-agent.cfg.md` and add:

```markdown
## Title: Meta-Agent System
- Name: Meta-BMad
- Customize: "Expert in creating and managing agent teams"

  - [Requirements Analysis](meta-agents#analyze-requirements)
```

### Step 4: Configure Build System

#### Create Meta-Agent Build Configuration

Create `build-meta-agent.cfg.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  orchestrator_agent_prompt: "./bmad-agent/meta-agents/personas/meta-orchestrator.md",
  agent_cfg: "./bmad-agent/meta-agents/meta-agent-config.md",
  asset_root: "./bmad-agent/meta-agents/",
  build_dir: "./build-meta/",
};
```

#### Test Build Process

```bash
# Test meta-agent build
node build-web-agent.js --config build-meta-agent.cfg.js

# Verify build output
ls -la build-meta/
```

### Step 5: Validate Integration

#### Test IDE Integration

1. Load BMAD orchestrator in your IDE
2. Verify meta-agents appear in agent list
3. Test loading meta-agent orchestrator: `/load-meta-bmad`
4. Verify meta-agent commands work

#### Test Web Integration

1. Build web agent with meta-agent configuration
2. Deploy to web platform (Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.)
3. Test meta-agent functionality
4. Verify all commands and workflows work

### Step 6: User Training and Documentation

#### Prepare Training Materials
