## Core Agent Design Patterns

### 1. Orchestrator Pattern

**Description:** Central coordinator managing multiple specialist agents
**When to Use:** Complex workflows requiring coordination between multiple specialized functions

**Structure:**
- One central orchestrator agent

- Clear communication protocols between orchestrator and specialists

**Example Implementation:**
```
Central Orchestrator
├── Specialist Agent A (Data Processing)
├── Specialist Agent B (Analysis)
├── Specialist Agent C (Reporting)
└── Specialist Agent D (Quality Assurance)
```

**Advantages:**
- Clear coordination and control
- Easy to add new specialist agents
- Centralized decision-making
- Simplified user interface

**Disadvantages:**
- Single point of failure
- Potential bottleneck at orchestrator
- Complexity in orchestrator logic

**Best Practices:**
- Keep orchestrator focused on coordination, not execution
- Design clear interfaces between orchestrator and specialists
- Implement robust error handling and recovery
- Plan for scalability and load distribution

```

**Advantages:**
- Simple and intuitive workflow

**Example Implementation:**
```
        Executive Agent
           ↙     ↘
    Manager A   Manager B
      ↙  ↘       ↙  ↘
   Agent1 Agent2 Agent3 Agent4
```

**Advantages:**

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. The God Agent
**Problem:** Single agent trying to do everything
**Solution:** Break into specialized agents with clear responsibilities
**Warning Signs:** Agent with too many diverse capabilities, complex decision logic, difficult to maintain

### 2. The Chatty Network
**Problem:** Excessive communication between agents
**Solution:** Design efficient communication protocols and minimize unnecessary interactions
**Warning Signs:** High communication overhead, performance bottlenecks, complex coordination

### 3. The Rigid Pipeline
**Problem:** Inflexible sequential processing that can't handle exceptions
**Solution:** Include error handling, alternative paths, and feedback loops
**Warning Signs:** Frequent pipeline failures, inability to handle edge cases, poor error recovery

### 4. The Isolated Islands
**Problem:** Agents that don't communicate or coordinate effectively
**Solution:** Design clear integration points and communication protocols
**Warning Signs:** Duplicate work, inconsistent results, poor user experience

### 5. The Bottleneck Hub
**Problem:** Central coordinator that becomes a performance bottleneck
**Solution:** Distribute coordination responsibilities or implement parallel processing
**Warning Signs:** Slow response times, resource contention, scalability issues
