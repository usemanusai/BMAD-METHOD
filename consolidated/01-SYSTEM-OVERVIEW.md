# Meta-Agent System Overview

## What is the Meta-Agent System?

The BMAD Meta-Agent System is a revolutionary addition to the BMAD Method that introduces a specialized team of AI agents whose purpose is to design, create, and configure other AI agent teams. This self-improving system can analyze problem domains and automatically generate optimized agent teams tailored to solve specific challenges.

### Core Concept: Agents That Create Agents

Meta-agents work at a higher level of abstraction than regular agents. Instead of solving business problems directly, they solve the problem of creating optimal agent teams to solve business problems. Think of them as "agents that create agents."

## System Architecture

```
